# DoenaSoft.StarTrekCalculator

This package calculates the Warp factors of Star Trek: The Next Generation / Deep Space Nine / Voyager into multiples of the speed of light (c).

It can also convert it the other way around.

Given a Warp factor and a distance in light years it can also calculate the time it takes to accomplish the journey.

The chart for the Warp factors can be found in [The Official Star Trek Files](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZBsFO.gif).

It can also convert the Stardate system used in these shows to convert them into actual dates and vice versa.
